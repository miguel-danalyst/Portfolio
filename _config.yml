  With up to five years of Business background experience and a Business Management Degree, 
  I began my journey into the world of Data Analytics in 2021.

  Since then I took Business Analytics courses that allowed me to gather knowledge and develop skills with tools such as Excel, SQL, Python and Power BI in order to improve my performance as a Data Analyst.
  
  After testing some small online projects, I decided to carry out my own project in the company where I worked. It took me four months and I loved it. It was a rollercoaster of emotions that ended up being the challenged I needed to tilt my complete focus into the Data Analytics world.
  
  Therefore I travel to Spain to begin a MBA in Business Analytics at Universitat Politécnica de Catalunya (UPC) to boost my analytics skills.
  
  Currently I’m working as Data Analyst in the Global Regulatory Services department of DSM-Firmenich for a Dashboard project.
